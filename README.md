🛍️ ***Amazon Sales Dashboard (Power BI)***
📊 **Project Overview**

This project is an interactive Amazon Sales Dashboard that I built using Power BI.
I worked on this project for several weeks, learning and applying different Power BI functions, DAX formulas, and visualization techniques along the way.

The goal was to analyze Amazon’s sales performance, understand customer behavior, and identify areas where the company can improve sales and profit.
Through this project, I got hands-on experience in data cleaning, data modeling, and storytelling with data.

Study customer demographics such as income level and occupation.

Find out top-performing and low-performing products.
